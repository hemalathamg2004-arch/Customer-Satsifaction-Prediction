# Customer-Satsifaction-Prediction
Customer Satisfaction Prediction is a machine learning project that analyzes customer support ticket data to identify patterns, visualize trends, and predict customer satisfaction levels using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques.
📊 Customer Satisfaction Prediction
🔍 Overview

Customer Satisfaction Prediction is an end-to-end data science and machine learning project focused on analyzing customer support ticket data to evaluate service performance and predict customer satisfaction levels. The project aims to uncover patterns in customer behavior and support operations using data-driven techniques.

📁 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of customer support tickets related to various technology products. It includes customer demographics, product details, ticket attributes, communication channels, response times, resolution durations, and customer satisfaction ratings. The data reflects real-world customer service scenarios and contains both numerical and categorical features.

⚙️ Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing involves handling missing values, cleaning inconsistent records, encoding categorical variables, and transforming features into suitable formats for analysis and modeling. This step ensures data quality and improves the reliability of machine learning models.

📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Exploratory Data Analysis is performed to understand ticket trends, identify frequently reported issues, analyze customer satisfaction distribution, and study relationships between satisfaction levels and factors such as age, gender, ticket type, priority, and support channel. Multiple visualizations are used to derive meaningful insights.

🧠 Feature Engineering

Relevant features are selected and engineered to capture key aspects of customer interactions and support efficiency. This includes analyzing response times, resolution timelines, and ticket characteristics that influence customer satisfaction.

🤖 Machine Learning Modeling

Supervised machine learning models are trained to predict customer satisfaction ratings based on historical ticket data. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is applied where necessary to improve model performance.

📊 Model Evaluation

Model performance is evaluated using appropriate evaluation metrics to assess prediction accuracy and reliability. Feature importance analysis is used to interpret the impact of different variables on customer satisfaction outcomes.
